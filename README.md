# rJKOtt

The project aims at modelling probability distributions with use of entropy-**r**egularized **JKO** scheme with **t**ensor-**t**rain decomposition.

The goal is, given pointwise access to the unnormalized density of a complicated probability distribution in high dimension, to fit a compressed model which will allow to sample from it and solve some downstream tasks.
